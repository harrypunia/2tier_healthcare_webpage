const ethicalDesc = 'Any discussion of healthcare systems is politically charged, and brings with it a diverse pool of ethical considerations. Traditionally, a health care system that is fully privatized (like the American system) would be considered extremely ‘right-wing’ or conservative. A completely public system would then be on the ‘left,’ liberal end of the political spectrum. Two-tier healthcare, which we are campaigning against, falls directly in the middle. This puts the people who support our cause already somewhere in the left, at least on this topic. Understanding the political implications of our stance on healthcare is very important as we look at the ethics of a two-tier system.<br/><br/>The most obvious ethical consideration in this debate is whether more money should mean better care service. Should a person who has a higher income have access to premium healthcare services, such as doctors, chospitals, and medication? For those who have grown up on the lower income side of a nation with a public healthcare system, the answer seems like an obvious no. The middle-class may have a harder time making this choice - while a two-tier system would make general wait times longer, they would be able to pay their way right to the front in an emergency. This is the ethical question that any citizen learning about two-tier healthcare has to approach. As designers on an ad campaign, we have a more complex set of ethical questions to consider.<br/><br/>What if our designs...<br/><br/>• Misrepresent the truth about healthcare?<br/><br/>• Target people of specific economic standing, based on biased assumptions on behalf of the design team?<br/><br/>• Are being paid for by a politically aligned agency (such as a left-wing campaign party) with a vested interest in people voting against two-tier healthcare as part of a larger plan?<br/><br/>• Convince people to adopt a healthcare system that eventually leads to their own illness or death?<br/><br/>• Convince people to adopt a healthcare system that bankrupts the federal or provincial government?';
const messagingDesc = "As designers, we are tasked with convincing people that a two-tier system is bad. Because it may not always be directly bad for the specific person reading the advertisement, it is our job to convince audiences that a two-tier healthcare system is bad for our society as a whole. Considering this, we wrote many of our ads to look at the broader strokes of influences a two-tier healthcare system brings.<br/><br/>Through doing research for this project we learned that in many ways, Canada already has a two-tier system (albeit through heavy government regulation.) We use this to argue our side of the issue, by using some of the many examples of private healthcare institutions in Canada being proven to be bad for the general public. This is something we rely on in quite a few of our advertisements by citing stories that have taken place recently in Canada, such as private clinics double billing patients, or privately built hospitals causing our government to spend money inefficiently.";
const approachDesc = "Instagram will be the primary platform for our ad campaign. This comes directly from our personas. Instagram was the social media service used either frequently or semi-frequently by every one of the individuals we are working to target. Current media trends also show a decline in the use of Facebook, alongside a rise in the use of Instagram. As we are approaching a topic that needs to appeal to a diverse range of people, we need to use the most universal platform. We will also roll the campaign out on Facebook and Twitter as a secondary platforms, as these are still platforms that are heavily used by some of our specific neutral groups targeted in our personas<br/><br/>Social media that caters more specifically to younger generations, such as Snapchat or TikTok, are completely off the table. A huge portion of these services’ user bases are too young to vote on issues like healthcare. Even if the ads reach people who could make an impact on the issue, the entire platform of these services revolves around delivering as much content as they can in as short a period of time as possible. This makes the window of time to convince someone about our topic much smaller, even when compared to other websites. By no means will have more than 15 seconds of our viewers’ attention on Instagram, but even that is a significant increase from how long content appears on TikTok or Snapchat."
